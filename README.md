# üì∑ Photo Share

This is a website that solves problems related to photo organization and sharing, as well as provides a platform for direct communication between users. The "Photo Share" app comes with an integrated messenger, allowing users to have private conversations with other photographers, discuss images, and provide feedback.

Additionally, users can share their "stories" - collections of photos that tell stories or capture impressive moments. This enables them to create thematic albums and share information about their creative ideas and projects.

Another interesting feature is the chat with the GPT system, which helps users ask questions and receive answers from a limited knowledge base related to photography and the creative process. This offers a quick way to access useful information and support on photographic aspects.

Overall, we are creating a functional and user-friendly application that brings together a community of photographers, enabling interaction, learning, inspiration, and growth in the field of photography.
